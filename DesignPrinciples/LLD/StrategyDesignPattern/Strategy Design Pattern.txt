The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable within the context of the object using them.

Basically and interface that has certain method and other classes implments to interface.
Main Execution class will 'has a' interface and other can get the object of any pattern.

Key Points:
Purpose: To enable a class's behavior to be selected at runtime without modifying the class itself.

Components:
Strategy Interface: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.
Concrete Strategies: Implement specific algorithms following the strategy interface.

Context Class: Holds a reference to a strategy and delegates algorithm execution to it.

Benefits:
Increases flexibility by allowing algorithms to be easily swapped.
Promotes code reuse and adheres to the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
Example: A payment system with strategies like CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment, allowing the user to choose the payment method at runtime.
In summary, the Strategy Pattern enables flexible, reusable algorithms that can be selected and changed dynamically.
