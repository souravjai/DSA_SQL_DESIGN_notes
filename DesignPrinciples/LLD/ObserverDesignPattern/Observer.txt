The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern used to create a one-to-many relationship between objects. In this pattern, an Observer object listens for changes in another Subject (or Observable) object. When the Subject changes state, it notifies all registered Observers, allowing them to react to the change immediately. This pattern promotes loose coupling by enabling objects to interact without being tightly dependent on each other.

Key Components:
Subject: The object being observed. It maintains a list of Observers and notifies them of changes.
Observer: The object that needs to be notified of changes in the Subject.
ConcreteSubject and ConcreteObserver: Specific implementations of the Subject and Observer.
Use Cases:
Implementing event handling systems (e.g., GUI elements reacting to user input).
Data syncing (e.g., a data model updating multiple views automatically).
Logging or monitoring systems.
